# Financial Concepts / Glossary

Occurs when maintenance is performed on the installment plan, as cancellation, chargeback or change in the amount of the sale 
installments. The same movement is to advance debts.

## Prepayment of Receivables (ARV)

Service offered to the customer affiliated with Cielo you want to anticipate receipt of your credit sales in cash and installments.

## Adjustment

financial posting to the credit or debit conducted by Cielo to rectify improper collection, cancel a sale or transfer one chargeback 
to the client.

## Extract Chain

This chain has no relation to the chain of payments of the company, so it is important to ask the EDI Island including all the stores 
that should be included in the extract files.

## Chain Centralized Payment

It is a group of customers with the same root CNPJ, bank address and the same trading conditions commission and run. A chain has only 
one mother, chosen by the customer, which are registered all goods and payments imposed in branches. The rules locks and antecipaçãosão the same for all clients in a centralized chain.

## Change Installment Plan

It occurs when the carrier calls the customer a change in the installment plan contracted at first, as a total or partial cancellation
of the sale and change in the amount or value of land.

## Date of Sale

Day on which the sale is conducted at Cielo client. For customers who operate e-commerce solutions, this is the date on which the 
carrier made the purchase on the site and not the date on which it was made to confirm the sale by Cielo client.

## Presentation of Data

Day the sale was submitted for processing in Cielo, being a Saturday, Sunday or holiday. This data is the basis for calculating the 
pay programming and may be different from the date of sale, according to the type of capture solution used.

## Data Capture

Date on which the transaction was captured on Cielo system. Cielo for customers who operate e-commerce solutions, this is the date on 
which the transaction was confirmed by the customer.

## Pay day

payment amount effective the day the customer's current account, considering the period of deferred payment. If the calculated date 
is not a business day, the payment will be made on the first working day. Initially, after the capture of the sale, it informed the 
scheduled date of payment, which may be delayed if the value is used to offset the collection of any debt arising from cancellation of sale, chargeback and billing services. Payment can also be anticipated if the customer performs a preparatory operation.

## Data Submission to the Bank

Date on which the payment file (credit or debit) was sent to the customer's home bank

## Discount Rate/Commission Rate

The discount is always calculated on the Operating Summary (RO) and in the case of installments store sales, the discount is on the 
RO that the parcel is located. The sum of the discount of the total value is demonstrated in the RO.

## Single Number of Transaction

It is awarded by Cielo and identifies each uniquely transaction, allowing the reconciliation of the stock adjustments, anticipation 
and assignment of receivables held both the RO and in the CV to be reconciled by this key To do this, the reconciliation solution 
should use only fixed parts of the single number following this composition.

|Shares|Composition|
|------|-----------|
|1|15 fixed positions that identify the summary of operations (RO) in a unique way, keeping the history of maintenance performed on 
Cielo.|
|2|07 variable positions. Identify changes made to the RO.|
|3|04 fixed positions that identify the Sales Receipt (DR) in a RO maintaining its track record in Cielo.|
|4|03 variable positions. They identify changes made to the CV.|

## Installment Shop - Term

Sales file with future installments option, all parcels will be sent with the original date of submission. However, the payment file 
will be shown the date of release of its share.For customers without this option the system will always demonstrate the date of 
submission of the tranche payment for the month. The calculation of the date of payment of all installments is based on the date 
on which the first portion and has a different logic for transactions of each of the flags, as follows:

### VISA, ELO and DINERS

The installments will be released monthly on the same day of the first part, whether the day is useful or not. Thus a sale in 04 
installments presented on 01.10.2015 will have the following release plan (payment term: 30 days):

|Portion|Date of transmission|Date of deposit (Portion of Liberation)| Date of payment|
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
|01/04|10/01/2015|10/01/2015|09/02/2015|
|02/04|10/01/2015|10/02/2015|12/03/2015|
|03/04|10/01/2015|10/03/2015|09/04/2015|
|04/04|10/01/2015|10/04/2015|11/05/2015|

The only exception to the above rule occurs when the day does not exist in the month of release of the plot. Example: Sales whose 
first installment was presented on 01/31/2015. As there is no 31 in February, the share of this month will be presented on the last 
day of the month, ie 02.28.2015.

### MASTERCARD

The filing date of the first installment will also be the base date for the release of all the flat portions, however, the future 
installments will always be 30 days after presentation of the first installment, keeping this logic to the completion of the plan. In the case of sale presented in 10/1/2015 previously used, we note that the installments will be released in 30, 60, 90 after the presentation of the first installment:

|Portion|Date of transmission|Date of deposit (Portion of Liberation)|Date of payment|
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------|
|01/04| 10/01/2015| 10/01/2015| 09/02/2015|
|02/04| 10/01/2015| 09/02/2015| 11/03/2015|
|03/04| 10/01/2015| 11/03/2015| 10/04/2015|
|04/04| 10/01/2015| 10/04/2015| 11/05/2015|

## Installment shop - Share of Value Rounding

It is always performed in the first portion and occurs where the result of the sale value of the division by the number of portions 
is a periodic tithe. In this case the first installment will be higher than the others.

## Adjustment

one debt adjustment will be generated in the value of the requested cancellation.

## Acceleration

an RO acceleration is generated for each maintenance performed with the amount of shares that were pending payment and were 
accelerated due to the total cancellation of the transaction. For partial cancellation, will accelerate the amount of parcels needed
to compensate for the amount canceled.

## Rescheduling

If the customer has the Sales extract option Installment Plan (03) enabled and there is a partial cancellation of a transaction, the 
system will generate the rescheduling records of parts which are not accelerated. This is because the original payment forecast sent 
has been changed and no accelerated installments assume the maturity of the plots that were accelerated.

Portion ## Rescheduling

Changing the due date of payment of the portion of the installment plan. It occurs when there is a partial cancellation of a plan with 
outstanding installments payment to the customer.

## Summary of Operations (RO)

The RO number identifies a grouping of sales in certain date. It has seven positions and will be formatted as follows. For example, 
a split transaction in the store held on 01/12/2015 4,151,201 will have the RO.

|Location|Description|Data Edition|
|-------|---------|---------------|
|1|Product Type|<ul><li>0 - open credit</li><li>3 - Outbound installments</li><li>4 - installments store</li><li>5 - card debit </li><li>6 - postdated electron</li></ul>|
|2 e 3|Year that the transaction was carried out|YY|
|4 e 5|month the transaction was carried out|MM|
|6 e 7|Day the transaction was carried out|DD|

## Transaction Rejection

It occurs when the client or the sale does not have the attributes necessary for the proper processing and scheduling of payment. 
The sale is reprocessed manually and sent for further payment.

## Sale

It occurs when there is a change in the payment schedule of a piecemeal sale, either in number of installments or the total value
of the transaction.

## Outstanding balance

It comprises all releases to receive from following the date of calculation. the Cielo payments not made in the past due to 
cancellations and objections should be considered.
